## Introduction

Wanted to investigate and predict and investigate trends in flight delay


## Methods

### Data Processing and Storage
(add in what you did ralph to merge the weather data)

biostat cluster using unix script - pre-prep and combining the separate data years
(cp in code a bit later), but rbind in the cluster worked, merging the datafiles together 
to 


bigmemory package (simplified to all number type columns, no need to use ff)  


### Analytics

biganalytics package
lme4

Use a linear regression on Delay ~ Weather Age Year
Linear miexed model on Delay ~ Weather Age + random Year

### Visualization
tidyverse family


## Results  

adljaf
(include figures and whatnot)


## Conclusion and Further Work

Pre- 9/11 era and comparison
